# Load IMU Sensor Data with Operation Labels

The data is saved in separate files for each sensor, because the sampling rate differs for each sensor.
Each record has timestamp information and we can combine the multiple data stream using the timestamps.

This tutorial explains how to combine two types of data. As an example, we will merge the IMU data (`atr01`) with the work operation's labels.
Once you know how to combine sensor data with ground truth, you can prepare data for model training.
